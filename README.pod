=head1 NAME

wolf (=work on latex file) provides a simple LaTeX IDE.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

similar to latexmk, this program compiles a latex file to pdf using 'pdflatex' and 
'bibtex' everytime the latex file or bibtex file or included files change.
Additionally this tool opens your favourite latex editor and your favourite 
viewer automatically.
At the end of compiling a summary of all errors and warnings is printed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--colors>, B<--no-colors>, B<--nocolors>

wolf is able to use colors for highlighting errors and warnings
default = B<--colors>

=item B<--editor>=I<string>

latex editor that shall be used. default: I<string> = choose automatically from 
one of "gvim|kile|emacs|kate" whatever is found first.

you may choose I<string> as 'emacs' to force trying emacs only or you may choose 
I<string> as 'gvim|emacs' to try gvim at first, and emacs if gvim can't be loaded

if I<string> is 'none', then no editor will be loaded.

=item B<--format-output>, B<--no-format-output>, B<--noformat-output>

wolf is able to re-format the stdout-output of pdflatex and bibtex in a better
readable way. it then tries to indent lines and reformat line-breaks.
default = B<--format-output>

=item B<--no-gui>, B<--nogui>

just a short cut for B<--pdfviewer>=I<none> B<--editor>=I<none>

=item B<--min-crossrefs>=I<int>

bibtex will automatically add a cross-referenced entry to the bibliography if the 
number of references using the cross-reference attribute \crossref is equal to or 
greater than I<int>. if you omit the param, then the default value (normaly 2) 
of bibtex will be used. some bibliography styles need a modification of this param,
e.g. for IEEEtran this should be set to 900, according to 
http://tug.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_bst_HOWTO.pdf.

wolf tries to detect the bibliography style. if it detects 'IEEEtran', then I<int> 
will be set automatically to 900, unless you did not set it manually.

=item B<--pdfviewer>=I<string>, B<--pdf-viewer>=I<string>

pdf viewer that shall be used. default: I<string> = choose automatically from one 
of "kpdf|evince|okular|acroread" whatever is found first.

you may choose I<string> as 'okular' to force trying okular only. or you may choose
I<string> as 'evince|kpdf' to try evince at first and kpdf if evince can't be 
loaded.

if I<string> is 'none', then no pdf viewer will be loaded.

=item B<--version>, B<-V>

prints version and exits.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

prints a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<--verbose>=I<number>, B<-v> I<number>

set grade of verbosity to I<number>. if I<number>==0 then no output
will be given, except hard errors. the higher I<number> is, the more 
output will be printed. default: I<number> = 1.

=item B<--silent, --quiet, -q>

same as B<--verbose=0>.

=item B<--very-verbose, -vv>

same as B<--verbose=2>. you may use B<-vvv> for B<--verbose=3> a.s.o.

=item B<--verbose, -v>

same as B<--verbose=1>.
